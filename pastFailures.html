<h1>Past Failures</h1>
<hr>
<p>
To contrast the successes, here are some prominent examples of failed (so far) attempts at global coordination:
</p>
<ul>
<li>International control of nuclear weapons: There have been a number of attempts at bringing about international control of nuclear weapons technology so as to mitigate the risk of nuclear war. Perhaps the most notable of these is represented by the Acheson-Lilienthal Report of 1946 [wiki-alreport]. A slightly modified version was proposed at the UN [wiki-baruch], but negotiations fell apart, ostensibly over disagreement between the US and the USSR as to whether the US would disarm before or after the scheme was set up [In any case, it seems unlikely that Stalin would have ultimately agreed to any system of international control given his extreme paranoia and megalomania. Though Stalin is an extreme case, this illustrates that the typical psychological makeup of people who occupy government leadership positions presents a major obstacle to any system that requires government leaders to voluntarily give up some of their power or to trust other leaders, even if that system will clearly result in a better situation for the rest of the world];
</li>
<li>Climate Change: Greenhouse gas emissions are by nature a global problem, where increased emissions from one region can offset reductions from another. International agreements aimed at limiting the worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases have generally failed. The most promising attempt was the Kyoto Protocol [wiki-kyotop], signed in 1997, under which developed nations pledged to limit their emissions. While European nations have generally fulfilled their treaty obligations and reduced emissions slightly, the United States never ratified the treaty, and Canada withdrew in 2012 after it became clear it would not meet its targets. The more recent Paris Agreement [wiki-parisa] is more vague and lacks any enforcement mechanism, and the United States has already announced its intent to withdraw. At the international level, these agreements have failed because there is no means to force compliance from nations that fail or refuse to reduce emissions. At the national level, opposition comes mostly from the economic tradeoffs required to reduce emissions. [Another substantial source of popular opposition is the cultural and often partisan backlash that formed in opposition to the environmentalist movement and its own partisan allies, although given the importance of those allies in accomplishing environmentalist goals, it's not clear whether a more politically neutral approach could have yielded better results.];
  </li>
<li>The League of Nations: The League of Nations [wiki-lon] and the post-World War I international diplomatic system that it represented were intended to promote global coordination and prevent war via disarmament, League-led dispute arbitration, and cooperative punishment of defectors. Despite some minor early successes [wiki-petrich], the League and its members failed to peacefully prevent powerful expansionary states like Japan, Italy, and Germany from building up their militaries and making the territorial seizures [wiki-manch] [wiki-abyssin] [wiki-ansch] that led to the outbreak of war;
  </li>
<li>Hague Conventions: The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 [wiki-hague] were meant to prevent wars via a court of arbitration and ensure that, if war did break out, it was conducted humanely. They were signed by every major belligerent in World War I, but all of them violated major parts of the agreement, including the ban on the use of chemical weapons. [This example and the others above illustrate the unsurprising point that agreements without strong enforcement mechanisms do not reliably prevent state actors from defecting when doing so provides a major strategic advantage];
  </li>
<li>Financial Crises: As mentioned above, worldwide financial markets are a crucial mechanism of decentralized global economic coordination. International financial crises such as stock market crashes or bursting asset bubbles are (limited) failures of this coordination mechanism, which in extreme cases can lead to years-long decline of economic activity on a regional or global scale. Notable examples include the Long Depression of 1873 through 1879 [wiki-longdep], the Great Depression of 1929 through the 1930s [wiki-grtdep], and the Great Recession of 2007 through the early 2010s [wiki-grtrec]. Many economists believe that governments have mitigated the severity of such crises via active central banks and extensive financial regulation.
