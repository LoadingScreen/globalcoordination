      <h1>Past Failures</h1>
<hr>
<p>
To contrast the successes, here are some prominent examples of failed (so far) attempts at global coordination:
</p>
<ul>
<li>International control of nuclear weapons: There have been a number of attempts at bringing about international control of nuclear weapons technology so as to mitigate the risk of nuclear war. Perhaps the most notable of these is represented by the Acheson-Lilienthal Report of 1946<sup><a href="#acb5:fn:1" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:1">1</a></sup>. A slightly modified version was proposed at the UN<sup><a href="#acb5:fn:2" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:2">2</a></sup>, but negotiations fell apart, ostensibly over disagreement between the US and the USSR as to whether the US would disarm before or after the scheme was set up<sup><a href="#acb5:fn:3" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:3">3</a></sup>;
</li>
<li>Climate Change: Greenhouse gas emissions are by nature a global problem, where increased emissions from one region can offset reductions from another. International agreements aimed at limiting the worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases have generally failed. The most promising attempt was the Kyoto Protocol <sup><a href="#acb5:fn:4" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:4">4</a></sup>, signed in 1997, under which developed nations pledged to limit their emissions. While European nations have generally fulfilled their treaty obligations and reduced emissions slightly, the United States never ratified the treaty, and Canada withdrew in 2012 after it became clear it would not meet its targets. The more recent Paris Agreement<sup><a href="#acb5:fn:5" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:5">5</a></sup> is more vague and lacks any enforcement mechanism, and the United States has already announced its intent to withdraw. At the international level, these agreements have failed because there is no means to force compliance from nations that fail or refuse to reduce emissions. At the national level, opposition comes mostly from the economic tradeoffs required to reduce emissions.<sup><a href="#acb5:fn:6" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:6">6</a></sup>;
  </li>
<li>The League of Nations: The League of Nations<sup><a href="#acb5:fn:7" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:7">7</a></sup> and the post-World War I international diplomatic system that it represented were intended to promote global coordination and prevent war via disarmament, League-led dispute arbitration, and cooperative punishment of defectors. Despite some minor early successes<sup><a href="#acb5:fn:8" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:8">8</a></sup>, the League and its members failed to peacefully prevent powerful expansionary states like Japan, Italy, and Germany from building up their militaries and making the territorial seizures<sup><a href="#acb5:fn:9" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:9">9</a></sup> <sup><a href="#acb5:fn:10" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:10">10</a></sup> <sup><a href="#acb5:fn:11" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:11">11</a></sup> that led to the outbreak of war;
  </li>
<li>Hague Conventions: The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907<sup><a href="#acb5:fn:12" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:12">12</a></sup> were meant to prevent wars via a court of arbitration and ensure that, if war did break out, it was conducted humanely. They were signed by every major belligerent in World War I, but all of them violated major parts of the agreement, including the ban on the use of chemical weapons. (This example and the others above illustrate the unsurprising point that agreements without strong enforcement mechanisms do not reliably prevent state actors from defecting when doing so provides a major strategic advantage);
  </li>
<li>Financial Crises: As mentioned above, worldwide financial markets are a crucial mechanism of decentralized global economic coordination. International financial crises such as stock market crashes or bursting asset bubbles are (limited) failures of this coordination mechanism, which in extreme cases can lead to years-long decline of economic activity on a regional or global scale. Notable examples include the Long Depression of 1873 through 1879<sup><a href="#acb5:fn:13" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:13">13</a></sup>, the Great Depression of 1929 through the 1930s<sup><a href="#acb5:fn:14" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:14">14</a></sup>, and the Great Recession of 2007 through the early 2010s<sup><a href="#acb5:fn:15" class="footnote" id="acb5:fn-back:15">15</a></sup>. Many economists believe that governments have mitigated the severity of such crises via active central banks and extensive financial regulation.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> The Acheson-Lilienthal Report was created in 1946 by a US State Department committee chaired by Dean Acheson (then Under Secretary of State) and David Lilienthal (then chair of the Atomic Energy Commission) which proposed the creation of an international agency that would control all nuclear technology. The United States representative to the UN Atomic Energy Commission, Bernard Baruch, used it as the basis for his proposal for nuclear disarmament, but this negotiations over this proposal fell apart over disagreement between the US and USSR over whether the US should disarm before or after the international agency was created.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> The Baruch Plan was an attempt to establish international oversight over the use of atomic energy, in the hopes of avoiding unchecked proliferation of nuclear power in a post World War II world. However, the Soviet Union felt that the plan allowed the United States to maintain its nuclear monopoly, and they did not vote to pass the plan.

  In any case, it seems unlikely that Stalin would have ultimately agreed to any system of international control given his extreme paranoia and megalomania. Though Stalin is an extreme case, this illustrates that the typical psychological makeup of people who occupy government leadership positions presents a major obstacle to any system that requires government leaders to voluntarily give up some of their power or to trust other leaders, even if that system will clearly result in a better situation for the rest of the world.

The Protocol's first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012. A second commitment period was agreed in 2012, known as the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, in which 37 countries have binding targets.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> The Paris Agreement is an agreement dealing with greenhouse-gas-emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance, signed in 2016. Under the Paris Agreement, each country must determine, plan, and regularly report on the contribution that it undertakes to mitigate global warming. No mechanism forces a country to set a specific target by a specific date, but each target should go beyond previously set targets. In June 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw his country from the agreement.

  Another substantial source of popular opposition is the cultural and often partisan backlash that formed in opposition to the environmentalist movement and its own partisan allies, although given the importance of those allies in accomplishing environmentalist goals, it's not clear whether a more politically neutral approach could have yielded better results.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> The League of Nations was an intergovernmental organization founded in 1920 explicitly intended to promote international cooperaitona and prevent war. Its primary architects were statesmen from the victorious states of World War I, especially America and Britain. It successfully resolved a few international disputes in its early years, but it did not prevent the future Axis powers of World War II from expanding their militaries and territory, and eventually the leading members of the League resorted to war to prevent their further expansion.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> In 1925, Bulgarian soldiers killed one or two Greek soldiers near the border between the two countries. In response, the Greek government sent troops into Bulgaria and demanded a cash payment in compensation. The Bulgarian government appealled to the League of Nations, and the League ordered Greece to withdraw its troops immediately and pay Bulgaria a small amount of money. Both countires accepted the ruling.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> The Japanese army invaded Manchura in September 1931 after Japanese military officers organized a fake “Chinese” attack on a Japanese railway that served as pretext for the invasion. After 5 months, the invasion was complete and the puppet government of Manchukuo was established. The League of Nations conducted an investigation and ultimately condemned Japanese actions and recommended Japan effectively return Manchuria to Chinese control. The Japanese ignored the recommendations and withdrew from the League.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> During 1934 and 1935, the Italian government majorly built up its military in its colonies bordering Ethiopia (then called Abyssinia), with the obvious intent to invade, which it ultimately did in October 1935. Over the course of the buildup and subsequent invasion, the Ethiopian government repeatedly appealed to the League of Nations. The League imposed insignificant sanctions on Italy, which the Italian government ignored. Statesmen of the leading members of the League, especially France and Britain, did not want to jeopardize their alliance with Italy, and so effectively allowed the conquest to occur.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> The Long Depression was a global economic downturn that took place from 1873 to 1879 or 1896 (there is disagreement among economic historians). It was precipated by a collapse in the market for bonds that led to the collapse of a number of major banks and railroad companies in Europe and the United States. During the depression, unemployment rates rose to over 10% in the United States, and economic growth was significantly slower or nonexistent in many countries relative to rates before and after the recession.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> The Great Depression was a global economic depression precipitated by the crash in prices on the New York Stock Exchange in 1929 and ending around 1939. Globally, unemployment rates rose dramatically (to as high as 25% in the U.S.), economic production significantly declined, and trade decreased substantially.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> The Great Recession was a global economic downturn that began with the global financial crisis of late 2007 (which involved a collapse in the real estate market fueled by mass-defaults on mortgages) and ended in the early to mid 2010s. It disproportionately affected Western economies. In the U.S. for example, economic production declined significantly, and unemployment rose to 10%.
