      <h1>General Strategy</h1>
<hr>
<div>
<p>
One way to frame the problem we're tackling here is that, save in some isolated cases<sup><a href="#f869:fn:1" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:1">1</a></sup>, humanity is not very strategic in pursuing its own long term interests. After all, as of 2017, we spend about 3 orders of magnitude more on advertising tobacco <sup><a href="#f869:fn:2" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:2">2</a></sup> than we spend on x-risk research<sup><a href="#f869:fn:3" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:3">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="#f869:fn:4" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:4">4</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>This problem, in turn, factors into 2 challenges that are better tackled in isolation:
  <p>
<ol>
  <li>Figuring out what humanity's long term interests are (“preference discovery”), and</li>
  <li>Steering the world towards outcomes that correspond to those preferences (“preference promotion”).</li>
</ol>
<p>
  (You can think of these challenges as rough generalisations of legislative and executive processes in democracies.)
The most popular mechanisms for (large scale) preference discovery in use today are democracy and free markets. Many believe that they seem to work better than the alternatives. However, they are ultimately limited:
</p>
</div>

<p><b>Democracy</b> (Interestingly, democracy is a coordination mechanism that was itself enabled by technological advances: modern democracy was enabled by the printing press [wiki-print] and secret ballot [wiki-ballot] — h/t Allan Dafoe, and Athenian democracy used sophisticated physical technology as well [dibbell-athens].) relies on non-corrupt officials and a sufficiently competent electorate, and it is clear that in some countries (e.g., Iraq and Afghanistan) naive democratization can be catastrophic. There is a correlation between a country's level of democracy and levels of wealth, education, and health, suggesting that these might be prerequisites to democracy <sup><a href="#f869:fn:5" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:5">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="#f869:fn:6" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:6">6</a></sup>, but making strong inferences from this observation is complicated by the problems inherent in reasoning about any macro-level correlation. And while they work well enough in many domains, democracies have a hard time addressing exotic or highly complex topics such as x-risk reduction <sup><a href="#f869:fn:7" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:7">7</a></sup>. Even if the electorate can understand the relevant analysis, focus on more emotionally salient issues can dominate policy discussion. Also, and relatedly, democracies appear increasingly vulnerable to malicious “election hacking” <sup><a href="#f869:fn:8" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:8">8</a></sup>.</p>
  <p>
    While democracy is intended as a mechanism by which the preferences of the citizens control the actions of the state, this is not so simple in practice. For one, the rulers of democracies have every incentive to influence the preferences of the voters. In order to acquire and maintain power, they can and frequently do employ means such as propaganda, state-sponsored media, and state-regulated education to alter the citizens' preferences to match their own.
</p>
<p>
  Another complication with democracy is that modern states are representative democracies which measure people's preferences about who they want in office, not their preferences about policy. This overweights preferences that are conductive to being associated with charismatic candidates.
</p>
<p>
  More fundamentally, as psychological research indicates <sup><a href="#f869:fn:9" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:9">9</a></sup>, people are often poor at predicting what they want from the future (Anecdotal example: by popular demand, Estonia abolished daylight saving time in 2000, only to reverse that decision 2 years later as people discovered, after all, that they valued the long summer evenings (plus the convenience of being in sync with the rest of Europe) above waking up at constant biological time), not to mention what policies would best serve them. In the absence of enlightened self-interest, democratic processes often decay to affiliation signalling <sup><a href="#f869:fn:10" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:10">10</a></sup> <sup><a href="#f869:fn:11" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:11">11</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
  Democracies are interesting in that they not only work to discover preferences, they also work to promote them, and these two capabilities are not separated — an attempt to sway and shape preferences is also an attempt to enact them (by getting votes and promoting popular legislation).
</p>
<p>
  <b>Free markets</b>, while working wonderfully across many domains as discovery and promotion mechanisms for valuable products and services (they can also deal with the “faster horse” phenomenon <sup><a href="#f869:fn:12" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:12">12</a></sup> better than democracy can), have their own limitations. For example, markets often fail to value common pool resources (such as non-polluted environment or x-risk reduction) <sup><a href="#f869:fn:13" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:13">13</a></sup> and don't necessarily track human values in contexts such as military technology <sup><a href="#f869:fn:14" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:14">14</a></sup>. In general, they value human well-being only indirectly<sup><a href="#f869:fn:15" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:15">15</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
  Even worse, markets can have catastrophic failure modes (e.g., “bubbles” <sup><a href="#f869:fn:16" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:16">16</a></sup>) where short term interests are promoted at the expense of long term sustainability [Indeed, in my opinion, the biggest disservice of capitalism might be the creation of a false sense of security: markets promote the development of powerful technologies that improve the lives of people in the short term, while also introducing global catastrophic risks from accidental or deliberate misuse of such technologies — “error or terror” scenarios, as Martin Rees<sup><a href="#f869:fn:17" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:17">17</a></sup> calls them].
</p>
<p>
  The existing mechanisms for global preference promotion are even worse: the UN is often accused of being very ineffective (at least in the face of the growing difficulty of the challenges that it faces<sup><a href="#f869:fn:18" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:18">18</a></sup>) <sup><a href="#f869:fn:19" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:19">19</a></sup>, so with a few exceptions (e.g., the Montreal Protocol<sup><a href="#f869:fn:20" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:20">20</a></sup>), the world struggles to enforce policies even backed by near consensus<sup><a href="#f869:fn:21" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:21">21</a></sup> <sup><a href="#f869:fn:22" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:22">22</a></sup> <sup><a href="#f869:fn:23" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:23">23</a></sup>. While there are proposals to increase the power of existing global governance structures<sup><a href="#f869:fn:24" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:24">24</a></sup>, this will be difficult because, above the state level, the world is basically an anarchy between competing “global tribes” <sup><a href="#f869:fn:25" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:25">25</a></sup>. Sadly, as Joshua Greene<sup><a href="#f869:fn:26" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:26">26</a></sup> writes in Moral Tribes<sup><a href="#f869:fn:27" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:27">27</a></sup>, “the very same moral thinking that enables cooperation within groups undermines cooperation between groups, \[because morality\] evolved as a device for successful intergroup competition. \[...\] We need a metamorality”.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Hopefully we could do much better in the future by explicitly considering a) the game-theoretic aspects of global processes and b) the new global technologies and movements that did not exist when democracy and free markets were invented. There may be ways to engineer <sup><a href="#f869:fn:28" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:28">28</a></sup> stable Nash equilibria that reward actors who help with global preference discovery and promotion — not unlike free markets today reward people and businesses to research and develop beneficial consumer products and services.
</p>
<p>
  In particular:
  <ol>
    <li>
For preference discovery, use technology and philanthropic actors to incentivise, automate, corruption-proof and scale existing empirically working mechanisms, such as polls <sup><a href="#f869:fn:29" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:29">29</a></sup>, focus groups, sentiment analysis <sup><a href="#f869:fn:30" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:30">30</a></sup>, courts, etc., and perhaps explore novel mechanisms <sup><a href="#f869:fn:31" class="footnote" id="f869:fn-back:31">31</a></sup>;
</li>
<li>
For preference promotion, use technology to incentivise people and institutions to align their goals and actions with the output of the preference discovery mechanisms — for example, by giving people the tools to easily expose deviations (“defection”) from such tracked preferences. More generally, we need coordination tools and organisations that can prevent (or at least detect and fix) bad Nash equilibria (e.g., various arms races) in various domains.
</li>
</ol>

  <br /><b>summary:</b>  This article describes Randy Thornhill and Corey Fincher's “parasite hypothesis of democratization”, according to which low levels of infection disease are necessary for democratization. In support of this is an observed correlation between parasite prevalence and levels of democracy and other liberal societal attributes. Thornhill and Fincher's explanation is that a high prevalence of disease means that interacting with strangers is riskier, which inflames tribalism and degrades trust, thereby weakening the possibility for democracy.

  <br /><b>summary:</b>  For the world's countries, there is a correlation between industrialization, democracy, and self-professed valuation of secularism, rationalism, and self-expression (as measured in certain polls). The author's explanation is that industrialization allows for a wealthy, educated middle class, which then takes effective political action towards democracy and supports the functioning of democracy once it is established.

  <br /><b>authors:</b>  Nick Bostrom
  <br /><b>summary:</b>  Current public-serving institutions are inadequate to the task of acting based on the expected value of existential risks. X-risk mitigation is a global public good (i.e., non-excludable and non-rivalrous), and economic theory suggests that such goods tend to be undersupplied by the market, since each producer (even if the producer is a large nation) could capture only a small portion of the value. The situation is even worse if the good is strongly transgenerational — most of the value being captured by people not yet alive. In addition to this, human judgment, individually and in aggregate, suffers from scope insensitivity. Even a reasonably informed electorate should be expected to have difficulty becoming properly calibrated to existential risks.

His standard methods involved manipulating social media, infecting computers and cell phones, eavesdropping, and stealing data. Despite working through contractors and proxies, he was eventually caught, and agreed to tell his story. The details of his activity remain difficult to verify, and his alleged employees from the political world predictably deny ever contracting illegal work.

  <br /><b>summary:</b>  Affective forecasting is the prediction of one's future well-being. The study of it in the context of this article was spearheaded by Daniel Kahneman and Jackie Snell in the 1990s. Researchers have found a number of common biases of the people they studied when doing affective forecasting, including the impact bias (the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on well-being), the focusing illusion (the tendency to overrate the significance of factors that are most attentionally salient), time discounting (the tendency to place more value on the short-term than the long-term), and projection bias (the tendency to project one's current emotional state onto future states).

  <br /><b>authors:</b>  Amy Chua
  <br /><b>summary:</b>  Chua argues that membership in ethnic, religious, racial, and tribal groups often drives people's political behavior throughout the world. American elites have often been blind to this fact because of universalist tendences in American political thinking, which focuses too much on ideology and ideological groups. This causes American elites to misjudge political situations, such as in Vietnam, where a Chinese minority dominated the capitalist class, making American promotion of capitalism unpopular. Similar judgments are made about Iraq, Afghanistan, Venezuela, and the US, where Donald Trump's membership in the same tribe as lower-class whites was critical to his success with them.

  <br /><b>summary:</b>  The phrase “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” is commonly attributed to Henry Ford, but there is no evidence he ever said these words. However, it is apparent from his business strategy that he did think along those lines. After the initial phase of production, in which he managed to disrupt the market with low prices, this way of thinking stopped serving him and his company well. The takeaway from this story is not that one should or shouldn't listen to customers, because that depends on the particular situation. Rather, the takeaway is that an innovator needs to always keep testing their vision against reality.

  <br /><b>summary:</b>  The tendency of common pool resources to be overconsumed, leading to their depletion or destruction. The traditional example is the cattle grazing commons: a community of ranchers each brings cattle to graze at the commons. An individual rancher can increase his benefit by bringing more cattle to graze, but if too many ranchers decide to do this, the commons will be depleted and everyone's benefit is reduced. In the absence of coordination mechanisms, the Nash equilibrium in this game is for everyone to defect. Many situations have similar properties, including pollution, fishing, and use of public spaces.

  <br /><b>summary:</b>  Autonomous weapons are those which make decisions about who and when to target, without human involvement at the time this is happening. Building autonomous weapons requires no difficult to obtain resources, and if they are developed they will also quickly become available on the black market to terrorists, dictators and other malicious actors. The letter has been signed by many well-known AI researchers and other prominent individuals.

  <br /><b>summary:</b>  Tulip mania or tulip fever refers to a period in the Dutch Golden Age in the seventeenth century. During this time, tulips quickly became a coveted luxury item, and the prices for tulip bulbs reached extraordinarily high levels. Then, in February 1637, the prices of tulips dramatically collapsed, greatly disrupting Dutch commerce. It is generally considered the first recorded instance of a speculative bubble.

  <br /><b>summary:</b>  After World War II, new international institutions (chiefly the UN and the Bretton Woods institutions) facilitated the development of a peaceful and prosperous interdependent world order. This was also paradoxically aided by the proliferation of nuclear weapons, because awareness of the prospect of mutually assured destruction necessitated greater cooperation amongst world powers. Now, that international order is in gridlock for (at least in part) four reasons: rising multipolarity (more players), harder problems (chiefly climate change), institutional inertia (specifically, international institutions continue to reflect the hierarchy of national powers immediately after WWII rather than today), and institutional fragmentation (there has been a proliferation of international organizations). Pathways out of gridlock include: 1) civil society coalitions with reformist governments; 2) autonomous and adaptive international institutions; 3) plurality and diversity of actors and agencies around common goals and norms; 4) interventions to alter the preferences of states over time; 5) threats to major powers' core interests.

  <br /><b>summary:</b>  The UN has been criticized for being ineffective, giving too much power to permanent security council states and other elite countries, for not respecting national sovereignty, for being biased against Israel, and for corruption and sexual abuse. For example, the UN's response to the Rwandan genocide has been criticized as ineffective — though UN peacekeepers were sent to Rwanda, they were basically bystanders during the genocide. Permanent members of the UN Security Council can veto any action by the Security Council, effectively preventing action from being taken against them. UN Security Council Resolutions have been criticized as being ignored without consequence, in part due to the UN's general inability to use coercive force to back up its resolutions. UN Peacekeepers have been reported to engage in child prostitution in several countries.

He references psychological studies conducted (many by him) on moral and political judgments and behavior in support of this claim. He argues that “system 1” deliberate thinking can help us to override our tribal instincts to be more rational in moral and political judgments.

  <br /><b>summary:</b>  Also known as “reverse game theory” and sometimes “incentive engineering”. Whereas game theory is the study of what outcomes obtain when rational agents are allowed to strategically act according to given game rules, mechanism design is the search for game rules that lead rational agents to a specified outcome. Auction design is one of the earliest and most-cited examples. Tools of mechanism design are of general interest in economic policy and institutional planning.

  <br /><b>summary:</b>  After realizing the importance of the algorithm behind PageRank (and CLEVER, which was based on roughly the same idea, but has not reached commercial success), the author wondered how to apply it to other domains. One area which appears to have a similar structure is human morality — or at least a certain aspect of it, which might be described as “a moral person is someone who cooperates with other moral people, and who refuses to cooperate with immoral people”. Applying an algorithmic solution to compute morality based on this insight results in intuitively sensible results, but requires making a difficult philosophical decision about whether it's necessary or merely acceptable to punish immoral people.
