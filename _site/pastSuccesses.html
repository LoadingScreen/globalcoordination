      <h1>Past Successes</h1>
<hr>
<p>Before we continue, let's review cases where humanity has successfully dealt with (or is attempting to deal with) bad Nash equilibria in various domains (The categorisation is somewhat arbitrary, as several examples fit multiple categories.) Also note that I'm using the term “meme” here and elsewhere in the document in its original meaning I've been told that some people are now allergic to the term after it started denoting “internet memes” — silly animated GIFs etc. Well, tough, it's a very useful concept still, so I don't see a good workaround to avoid its use)<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:1" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:1">1</a></sup>.
</p>
<h2>Self-regulation</h2>
<ul><li><b>Asilomar:</b> The guidelines from the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:2" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:2">2</a></sup> are often given as an example of a successful industry self-regulation. Not only did the Asilomar Conference successfully set a precautionary precedent for the use of newly discovered DNA research methods, it also increased public interest and awareness of developments in the field.
</li></ul>
<h2>Government</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Smallpox:</b> The decade-long WHO campaign that eradicated naturally-occurring smallpox<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:3" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:3">3</a></sup>;
    </li>
  <li><b>Ozone:</b> UN-led Montreal Protocol that phased out ozone-depleting substances and fixed the ozone layer<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:4" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:4">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:5" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:5">5</a></sup>. Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has called it “perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date”<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:6" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:6">6</a></sup>;
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Y2K Problem</b>: In 1999 the UN created an international cooperation centre<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:7" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:7">7</a></sup> to mitigate the Y2K problem<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:8" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:8">8</a></sup>. Lacking prominent examples of averted disasters, its impact is hard to assess, but it certainly serves as an additional data point in the history of international coordination efforts;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Arms Treaties</b>: Various arms control treaties [wiki-acontrol], such as the Biological Arms Convention<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:9" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:9">9</a></sup>, Chemical Arms Convention<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:10" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:10">10</a></sup>  and Blinding Laser Weapons Protocol<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:11" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:11">11</a></sup> (Importantly, the stability of arms treaties is a function of technological and geopolitical power balance: for instance, right now, Russia seems eager to back out of the soviet-signed *INF treaty*<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:12" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:12">12</a></sup> to compensate for its weakness in conventional forces<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:13" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:13">13</a></sup>);
      </li>
</ul>
<h2>Activism and Memetics</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Tobacco:</b> The recent reduction in tobacco consumption<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:14" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:14">14</a></sup> (especially in the developed world) <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:15" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:15">15</a></sup> seems to be largely activism-related and memetic in origin;
    </li>
  <li>
    <b>Nuclear Waste:</b> Perhaps as a result of the aforementioned anti-nuclear campaign, when it comes to nuclear waste treatment and disposal, people seem to have concerns that span uncharacteristically long time horizons (Pointed out to me by Martin Rees <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:16" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:16">16</a></sup>) <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:17" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:17">17</a></sup>. People seem to care less about whether the future generations exist than they care about not burdening them with radioactive waste!
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Ideologies and Norms</b>: For better or for worse, religions and other mass-ideologies (e.g., liberalism, republicanism, human rights movement) have served as strong (possibly the strongest) group coordination mechanisms<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:18" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:18">18</a></sup> <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:19" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:19">19</a></sup>. Ideologies (some emergent, some engineered<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:20" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:20">20</a></sup>) often bias the behaviour of individuals (“meme carriers”) towards what's good for the group and for the ideology (“the meme”) itself<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:21" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:21">21</a></sup> <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:22" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:22">22</a></sup> <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:23" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:23">23</a></sup>;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Anti-nuclear Campaign</b>: After World War II there was a systematic campaign by highly respected scientists and intellectuals, many of whom had been instrumental in the development of nuclear weapons, to turn people against further weapons development, build support for disarmament and international control, and highlight the health risks of nuclear technology. Many institutions were set up for this purpose, such as the Federation of American Scientists<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:24" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:24">24</a></sup> and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:25" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:25">25</a></sup> (see also the Russell-Einstein Manifesto<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:26" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:26">26</a></sup>). This may have had a large counterfactual effect on people's views about nuclear weapons and nuclear energy;
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>The Leviathan:</b> Significant improvements to the human condition and humanity's ability to coordinate have been brought about by the creation of functioning states. A prominent example being the pacification of the populace (reducing violence by about an order of magnitude)<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:27" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:27">27</a></sup> <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:28" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:28">28</a></sup>;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Global Standards:</b> Some global problems can be solved by a shared standard. This is a coordination problem, but in some cases it can be a relatively easy one to solve because deviating from a global standard can be costly. For example, definitive global standards already exist in the realms of civil aviation and the postal system<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:29" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:29">29</a></sup> <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:30" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:30">30</a></sup>;
          </li>
          <li>
            Military Alliances: Coordination between allied militaries can be extremely deep. Typically, such coordination means that the cooperating nations have extremely strong incentives to cooperate (such as an imminent invasion). This category of coordination can be seen as an extreme case where devastating harm is fully expected unless drastic coordinated action is taken (and thus extreme political will is used to forge coordination at all costs) <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:31" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:31">31</a></sup> <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:32" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:32">32</a></sup> <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:33" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:33">33</a></sup> <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:34" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:34">34</a></sup> <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:35" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:35">35</a></sup>;
            </li>
            <li>
              Peremptory Norms (jus cogens): International norms from which no derogation is permitted. That is, the nations and peoples of the world have decided that these rules should never be broken under any circumstance. Surprisingly, some of these norms have been extremely successful even without a central governing body. Essentially, these are the fetters on the sovereignty of nations that nations themselves have generally agreed to. Examples include the prohibition of genocide, maritime piracy, slavery, torture, refoulement, and wars of aggression <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:36" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:36">36</a></sup>. These norms can be regarded as examples of spontaneous consensus <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:37" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:37">37</a></sup>.
              </li>
    </ul>
<h2>Self-Enforcing Protocols</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Property Rights and Trade</b>: Probably the biggest coordination mechanisms invented so far. By requiring mutually agreeable prices and enabling the creation of markets, they enable division of labour and exploitation of different comparative advantages on a global scale<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:38" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:38">38</a></sup>;
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Liturgies</b>: In ancient Greece the Athenians had a system called liturgies<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:39" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:39">39</a></sup> where the richest people were obligated to pay for public goods, such as defense and sports. The clever bit was ranking wealthy people by their (un)willingness to, in principle, exchange all their possessions with others: If person A won't willingly exchange all their possessions with person B, but person B does agree to such an exchange, A was presumed richer;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Øresund Tax:</b> In the 16th century, the Kingdom of Denmark taxed ships passing through the strait of Øresund based on self-declared value of their cargo. To keep skippers honest, the crown reserved the right to purchase the cargo at the declared price<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:40" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:40">40</a></sup>. Eric Posner and Glen Weyl have proposed a generalized version of this self-assessment system in which anyone, not just the state, can buy any asset at the self-declared value<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:41" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:41">41</a></sup> <sup><a href="#81f3:fn:42" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:42">42</a></sup>;
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>VAT:</b> Arguably, the emergence of the value added tax<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:43" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:43">43</a></sup> as one of the world's dominant revenue instruments is largely due to its game-theoretic properties<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:44" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:44">44</a></sup>: businesses are incentivised to report to the government the invoices they have received, as that determines their VAT rebate;
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Blockchain:</b> Blockchain technologies<sup><a href="#81f3:fn:45" class="footnote" id="81f3:fn-back:45">45</a></sup> (discussed subsequently in greater detail) often rely on self-enforcing protocols to establish various desired properties.

<br /><b>summary:</b> A meme refers to an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas or symbols that can be transmitted from one person to another through writing, speech, or other phenomena. Memes are thought to be cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures. The term was coined in Richard Dawkins' 1976 book The Selfish Gene.

<br /><b>summary:</b> The English physician Edward Jenner demonstrated the effectiveness of cowpox to protect humans from smallpox in 1796, after which various attempts were made to eliminate smallpox on a regional scale. This was the first vaccine to be developed (the word vaccine is derived from the scientific name for cowpox). Vaccination programs caught on around the Western world in the early-to-mid-1800s, after initial concerns over safety were alleviated. The WHO began an international search for smallpox outbreaks in 1967, with attendant vaccinations. They announced eradication in 1980. There remain stockpiles of the disease in secure bio research facilities.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> In the 20th century, computer storage was generally much more expensive, putting pressure on programmers to reduce storage requirements wherever possible. One common shortcut was to use only the last 2 digits of years. This created the potential for various logical errors when 99 rolled over into 00. The International Y2K Cooperation Center was established in 1988 by 120 cooperating countries, with funding from the World Bank. It established an office in Washington D.C. in 1999.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> Tension is building between Russia and NATO countries. While war doesn't seem imminent in the west, Russians feel as if it's a possibility. One in three Russians think the U.S. may invade Russia. The situation is more like pre-World War I Europe than the Cold War. During the Cold War Russia and the U.S. were more closely matched, but now Russia is much weaker than the U.S. This condition makes dangerous courses of action more advantageous to Russia and could lead to war. Putin has also said that he is willing to use nuclear arms in attempt to win smaller-scale conflicts. A conflict could start between Russia and one of its border nations that NATO is legally required to get involved in. Some thinkers believe Putin's aim is to prove that NATO won't start a massive conflict to protect a small country that it has promised to protect. Russia may provoke NATO by engaging in “hybrid war” which uses modern tactics like cyber attacks and provoking unrest to blur the line between what is and isn't war. Putin's seeming openness to using nuclear missiles could lead to a catastrophic conflict.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> Tobacco use is declining and the number of non-smokers is rising, but the World Health Organization says governments need to intensify their efforts. The goal to cut global tobacco consumption 30% by 2025 won't be met if the trend of smoking cessation stays the same. The effort to reduce smoking by making tobacco companies use plain packaging with warning labels is being held up by tobacco companies' threats of long and costly litigation.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> About one third of people over the age of 15 smoke cigarettes. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death. There are modern methods to incentivize people not to begin smoking or to quit, but less than a tenth of the world's population live in a place where these methods are being used. Smoking rates in developed countries have fallen in the past four years, but production of tobacco has risen in low and middle-resource countries.

  <br /><b>authors:</b> Ahmed Kabil
  <br /><b>summary:</b> Management of nuclear waste attracts a significant amount of public and political attention. In general, local populations and governments don't want it stored in their area and often successfully block attempts to do so. The most notable case is that of the planned national nuclear waste repository in Nevada, which the government began to construct, but which has since been shut down by local politicians. One possible solution is to reprocess or recycle the waste, but this has been effectively banned in the United States. Temporary storage facilities in Texas and New Mexico are proposed, but the government has no long-term plan for dealing with waste, and support for nuclear energy amongst the public is at an all-time low.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> “[R]eligions often maintain intragroup solidarity by requiring costly behavioral patterns of group members. The performance of these costly behaviors signals commitment and loyalty to the group and the beliefs of its members. Thus, trust is enhanced among group members, which enables them to minimize costly monitoring mechanisms that are otherwise necessary to overcome the free-rider problems that typically plague collective pursuits.”

  <br /><b>authors:</b> Francis Fukuyama
  <br /><b>summary:</b> The first of Francis Fukuyama's two volumes on the history and dynamics of governance (the second being Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Globalization of Democracy), this book describes his theory by showing how it explains the origin (and dynamics) of political order in several historical contexts. Beginning with an examination of kin group dynamics in human prehistory, this work then examines the power of religion to facilitate cooperation between much larger groups of people. Much of the rest of the book is spent on several very thorough analyses of the development of political order in different regions of the world. By examining several very different societies through the lens of his theory, Fukuyama demonstrates its broad explanatory power even though he himself declares that the theory is less than fully predictive, as all such theories must necessarily be. Fukuyama's theory is, in short, that the best governance comes about from development of and balance between three factors: 1) a strong and modern state, 2) the rule of law, and 3) accountability of the government to the will of the people. In a nation with highly capable governance, such as Denmark, all of these factors are very strong and they are in rough balance with each other. Various other political forms emerge when these factors are out of balance, each of which is shown to be disadvantaged compared to the more equal distribution.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> Scientology is a body of religious beliefs and practices developed in 1954 by American author L. Ron Hubbard. Hubbard initially developed a program of ideas called Dianetics, an alternative to standard psychology and psychotherapy, distributed through the Dianetics Foundation. The foundation went bankrupt, after which Hubbard recharacterized the subject as a religion and renamed it Scientology. The Church of Scientology engages in multiple controversial policies, including the organized harassment of perceived enemies (a practice officially endorsed as the “Fair Game” policy), and the shunning of family members considered “antagonistic” to the church. Members at higher levels are taken aboard boats and given a doctrine Hubbard called “space opera,” involving a 75-million-year-old galactic confederacy led by a tyrant named Xenu who initiated life on earth. Estimates put membership in the tens of thousands, in decline since the end of the 20th century.

  <br /><b>authors:</b> Kathleen McAuliffe
  <br /><b>summary:</b> David Pizarro, a professor teaching moral psychology, claims that the emotion of disgust played a central role in shaping people's moral instincts. At the same time, he recommends to transcend these instincts, which return false positives on many cases considered innocuous on ethical grounds. Experimental subjects exposed to an unrelated stimulus which caused disgust showed a change in their attitudes towards immoral behavior, religion, societal rules, and even politics. Psychopaths and people with Huntington's disease have a greatly reduced sensitivity to disgusting objects. When human ancestors switched from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to farming, maintaining cleanliness became crucial for survival of their communities. It is likely that abiding strictly by religious and societal laws was in those times a very adaptive strategy, and influenced the last stretch of human evolution.

The national identity fostered and celebrated by these propaganda efforts included both existing and new aspects of British culture. The main reason for doing this was to win the war, which required the coherent mobilization of all of the various peoples of the United Kingdom.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> Many social insects have mechanisms to punish defectors against the common good. For many of the most successful, these mechanisms involve all insects punishing defections harshly. Systems where only some agents punish defectors run the risk of empowering the punishers, since they may not have adequate oversight. A potential solution, in theory, is enabling all agents in a system to punish defectors: this avoids corruption and makes defecting less attractive for all agents.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> Hobbes' Leviathan, published in 1651, is a highly influential work of political philosophy. It includes Hobbes' famed exploration of “the state of nature” — where he describes an anarchic, violent, and hopeless world. Hobbes' answer to the game-theoretic dilemma of the state of nature is the Leviathan, an assemblage of people, rules, and resources that together form the secular and spiritual foundation of society. The Leviathan can solve the problems of the state of nature by acting as the disinterested third party for individual disagreements with unchallengeable power and authority. In common usage, the Leviathan is equated with the government of a State.

He credits several processes, such as nation-state monopolies on force, commerce, and increased literacy and communication as playing a role in this decline in violence. Pinker also points out that despite this decline in violence, people generally do not perceive that current times are less violent than before.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> In the Athenian city-state of the 4th and 5th century political officials were chosen by lot among male citizens over 30 to serve for one year terms. People were either citizens, resident aliens, or slaves. In court cases juries of about 500 decided both guilt or innocence and punishment by majority vote. Prosecutors were incentivized because they could take the wealth of those they prosecuted. If they presented a case in which less than one fifth of the jury voted in their favor, their own wealth would be taken and they'd be banned from prosecuting in similar cases. Athenians believed in a contagious pollution of the self that caused bad luck called miasma. Miasma was said to be created as a result of certain acts (like murder). Athenian women had a male in control of them- first their fathers, later their husbands. Men were legally required leave their inheritance to their sons. The only way around this was adopting other sons. Rich Athenians were required to produce a public good every two years. They could get out of this only by proving another person was richer than they were.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> This paper does a game-theoretical analysis of self-declared value taxation, in which the owners of a taxed asset declare the assets value, and the government has the right to purchase the asset for that value. Using a set of assumptions that somewhat simplify the scenario, the researchers demonstrate that the equilibrium of the situation is for the government to purchase the assets some fixed percentage of the time regardless of the declared value. This will not induce owners to tell the truth about the value of their asset, but it will result in the government collecting the desired tax revenue.

  <br /><b>authors:</b> Robin Hanson
  <br /><b>summary:</b> Hanson describes some benefits of “stability rents”, or taxes that are tied to a price at which a property owner is willing to sell that property. In a system of stability rents, people would declare the value of their property, and then pay a tax based on that declared value. However, anyone who wanted to could buy the property at the stated value, creating an incentive to declare a higher value and ensure stable ownership. In some sense, our current equilibrium is a special case where stability rents are set to zero, and Hanson is convinced by academics Eric Posner and Glen Weyl that zero is not the optimal level.

  <b>title:</b> On Radical Markets

  <br /><b>arcurl:</b> http://web.archive.org/web/20190416201950/https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/04/20/radical_markets.html

  <br /><b>authors:</b> Vitalik Buterin
  <br /><b>summary:</b> This article is a review of Posner and Weyl's book Radical Markets. It focuses on their proposal for generalized Harberger taxes, i.e. self-assessed property values with the condition that any buyer can buy the property for the declared value. This system would in theory have a number of advantages: it would result in property being allocated more efficiently, to those who most value the property, it would incentivize accurate value assessment, and it would reduce or eliminate the costs associated with bureaucratic property assessment. A similar scheme was proposed for Ethereum domain names, but was rejected because it would be liable to result in too much ownership churn, and would in some cases result in scammers using trusted domain names to steal from people. The book's reform proposals are centralized, but there are also possibilities for decentralized radical reform, like assurance contracts and prediction markets.

  <br /><b>authors:</b> Kathryn James
  <br /><b>summary:</b> This academic book attempts to explain the rise of the value-added tax, which has come to be widely adopted by nation-states over the past several decades. Typical explanations are inadequate because they explain the VAT's rise by virtue of certain merits of the VAT conceived in a general sense, but the actual implementations of the VAT usually fail to have these merits. Instead, the author proposes that the adoption of a VAT can only be explained by examining the political context of its adoption, including especially the institutions and local incentives involved. She conducts case studies of the VAT in Australia and the US to illustrate this point.

  <br /><b>authors:</b> 2009-08-11
  <br /><b>authors:</b> Bruce Schneier
  <br /><b>summary:</b> Self-enforcing protocols are protocols designed to make cheating impossible. Most transactions between two people require a third party like a bank to keep both sides honest. Self-enforcing protocols are useful because they don't require a third party but they also make cheating not advantageous. An example of a self-enforcing protocol is the “cut-and-choose”. This is when one person cuts a piece of cake into two supposedly equal pieces and the other person chooses which piece to take for themself. The cutter is motivated to cut the pieces as equally as possible because cheating wouldn't benefit them.

  <br /><b>summary:</b> Blockchain was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public ledger of bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. It is part of a program that enables self-interested strangers on the internet to collectively maintain a tamper-resistant record of transactions, without the need for a trusted central authority (like a bank). Consider the case of online multiplayer games, wherein players may collect items and in-game currency, which they can exchange among each other. This in-game economy relies on the implicit trust that the game admins will not capriciously delete, copy, or otherwise devalue those online assets. In contrast, the cryptographic features of a blockchain can provide guarantees against this, allowing the transactions of digital assets to be completed trustlessly. The blockchain data is distributed among many machines that communicate as a peer-to-peer network. It is called a blockchain because each update to the record comprises a batch (block) of transactions which get time-stamped and linked to the previous block using a cryptographic hash. Including this hash makes it impossible to alter an old block without altering every subsequent block, which requires a very large amount of computational power. Ideally, the incentives of a blockchain protocol should induce all participants to promote the integrity and continued updating of the records as a consequence of selfish activity.
