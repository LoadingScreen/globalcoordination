<h1>Past Successes</h1>
<hr>
<p>Before we continue, let's review cases where humanity has successfully dealt with (or is attempting to deal with) bad Nash equilibria in various domains (The categorisation is somewhat arbitrary, as several examples fit multiple categories.) Also note that I'm using the term “meme” here and elsewhere in the document in its original meaning{% fn %} {% fn %}.
</p>
<h2>Self-regulation</h2>
<ul><li><b>Asilomar:</b> The guidelines from the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA{%fn%} are often given as an example of a successful industry self-regulation. Not only did the Asilomar Conference successfully set a precautionary precedent for the use of newly discovered DNA research methods, it also increased public interest and awareness of developments in the field.
</li></ul>
<h2>Government</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Smallpox:</b> The decade-long WHO campaign that eradicated naturally occurring smallpox{%fn%};
    </li>
  <li><b>Ozone:</b> UN-led Montreal Protocol that phased out ozone-depleting substances and fixed the ozone layer [ozone-fixed] [ozone-return]. Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has called it “perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date” [wiki-montreal];
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Activism and Memetics</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Tobacco:</b> The recent reduction in tobacco consumption [tobacco-drop] (especially in the developed world) [tobacco-1world] seems to be largely activism-related and memetic in origin;
    </li>
  <li>
    <b>Nuclear Waste:</b> Perhaps as a result of the aforementioned anti-nuclear campaign, when it comes to nuclear waste treatment and disposal, people seem to have concerns that span uncharacteristically long time horizons (Pointed out to me by Martin Rees {%fn%}) {%fn%}. People seem to care less about whether the future generations exist than they care about not burdening them with radioactive waste!
  </li>
    </ul>

  I've been told that some people are now allergic to the term after it started denoting “internet memes” — silly animated GIFs etc. Well, tough, it's a very useful concept still, so I don't see a good workaround to avoid its use
